# Privacy Policy

Leet2Git does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.

All data processing happens locally in the user’s browser. OAuth tokens and GitHub information are stored using Chrome's extension storage API and are never sent to any external server.

We do not use analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party data processors.

Leet2Git is strictly limited to its single purpose: exporting accepted LeetCode problems to the user’s own GitHub repository.
